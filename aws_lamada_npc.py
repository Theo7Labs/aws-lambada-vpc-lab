AWS Hands-On Lab Experience

Project: Deploying AWS Lambda in a VPC with Internet Access

Summary:
Successfully deployed an AWS Lambda function inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and configured the necessary networking components to allow outbound internet access. Troubleshot and resolved connectivity issues by implementing a NAT Gateway, modifying route tables, and adjusting security group settings.

Technical Skills & Tools Used:
- AWS Services: Lambda, VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, Security Groups, CloudWatch
- Networking Concepts: Private and Public Subnets, NAT Gateway for outbound traffic, Elastic IPs, Routing
- Security: IAM roles, Security Group rules, Outbound and Inbound traffic configurations
- Troubleshooting Tools: AWS CloudWatch Logs, AWS Console diagnostics

Key Responsibilities & Achievements:
- Configured AWS Lambda within a VPC, ensuring a secure and controlled environment for execution.
- Designed a networking architecture with public and private subnets, ensuring Lambda could access the internet while maintaining security best practices.
- Deployed and associated a NAT Gateway, enabling private subnet instances (Lambda function) to establish outbound internet connectivity.
- Modified Route Tables to direct outbound traffic from the private subnet to the NAT Gateway, resolving Lambda connectivity issues.
- Adjusted Security Group rules to allow necessary traffic, preventing restrictions that blocked internet access.
- Resolved execution timeout errors by verifying proper routing and network settings, improving Lambda function execution time and stability.
- Verified and assigned Elastic IPs to the NAT Gateway to ensure persistent outbound connectivity.
- Performed troubleshooting and log analysis using AWS CloudWatch to diagnose failed Lambda executions and confirm successful internet access.

Challenges & Solutions:
- Challenge: Lambda function execution timed out when attempting to access external services.
- Diagnosis: The function was deployed in a private subnet with no outbound internet access.
- Solution:
  - Implemented a NAT Gateway and updated route tables to allow outbound traffic via the gateway.
  - Ensured proper security group configurations, allowing traffic to and from the required AWS services.
  - Validated successful internet access through AWS CloudWatch logs and Lambda test executions.

Result & Impact:
- Successfully enabled AWS Lambda to access the internet from a private subnet in a VPC.
- Gained hands-on experience troubleshooting AWS networking configurations.
- Improved understanding of AWS security best practices, including least privilege access controls for Lambda execution roles.

How This Experience Enhances My AWS Skillset:
This project demonstrates practical expertise in AWS networking and serverless architecture, essential for roles in Cloud Engineering, AWS DevOps, and Solution Architecture. It showcases my ability to design, deploy, and troubleshoot cloud-based solutions, making me a valuable asset for AWS-related positions.
